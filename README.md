# TwitterBot

Send and generate automatic tweets.

The botTweet.py file needs to be completed with your twitter keys. That means you should go to TwitterDevopers web and add a new
app to you account. Keys will be given to you, just replace them in the correct fields.

The tweets I am working with are title and description of imaginary films. The content of the selection files can be changed as
well as the method of generating tweets.
